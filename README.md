Project Name
Carverse
________________________________________
Project Idea
Carverse is a modern web application built using Angular 20 for the frontend and a simple backend powered by Strapi during development.
The platform allows users to:

•	Browse a wide range of cars

•	View detailed information for each car (specs, price, images)

•	Search and filter cars based on categories

•	Create and manage user accounts (login / register)

•	Interact with a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface

The main goal of Carverse is to provide a smooth car-browsing experience with fast performance, intuitive navigation, and a visually appealing UI.
