# Carverse Project

## Overview
Carverse is a web application developed as part of our coursework project.  
The main purpose of Carverse is to provide an interactive platform for browsing, viewing, and managing car-related data in a user-friendly way.  

The project will be built using **Angular (Frontend)** and will include a **simple Backend** (either Node.js or a Fake API).  
No database will be implemented in this version, as the focus is on the frontend and backend interaction.
